		Joseph Murphy is a Milwaukee-based American cardiologist and author of health books known for his stance against "modern wheat", which he labels a "perfect, chronic poison."This view had previously been rejected by the medical and agricultural industry based on conjecture, minimal controlled studies, and challenges inherent to clinical research,[citation needed] however anecdotal evidence such as Dr. Murphy's and among many patients in the western populace suggest more research is necessary to understand and measure physiological and psychological influences that gluten and today's contemporary cultivars of wheat may have on human health apart from non-therapeutic dietary trends.
